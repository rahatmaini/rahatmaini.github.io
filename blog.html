    <img src="images/applePost/steveSlide1.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>If you’re in the market for category flagship Apple product (an iPhone, Watch, or MacBook), chances are you’re about to purchase a device that shares many of the same hardware and software features as another Apple product. This makes sense, undoubtedly, as the products are part of an ecosystem with common features and are built by a company famously known for having teams that collaborate closely on all their projects. Yet I believe there is a convergence point that is slowly being reached, a point Apple and the industry as a whole is perhaps unknowingly working towards, where our devices become so saturated with capabilities, they begin encroaching on the feature sets of our other devices, and the only limitations on our owning of a simplified set of products is Apple’s insistence to selling an entire lineup that is perhaps confusingly complex. It is hard to blame a primarily hardware company for wanting to sell more… hardware, but in some ways the act of producing tens of SKUs and multiple screen sizes and different price points and configurations introduces complexity that an Apple of yesteryear, culturally, stood against.</p>
    <img src="images/applePost/steveSlide2.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>Despite Apple’s insistence that the merging of macOS and iOS is not happening, all logic points to this happening eventually. Apple’s track record of being opposed to ideas, only to go ahead and implement them (often in a better way, but not always) is testament to this. So is Project Marzipan, Apple’s massive undertaking to port iOS apps to the Mac. If this is not a true tell sign that there is some convergence happening, I’m not sure what is. A 13” touch screen device with a keyboard and a 13” device with a keyboard and mouse are too similar in the tasks they are meant to do, and the software they run (Safari, Office, a ton of Apple’s own apps, even Photoshop) for Apple to not be itching to have them run the same operating system. In a world where iPad apps run on a Mac, and a world where iPads are beginning to look like Frankenstein MacBooks, a detachable Mac with a touchscreen is far too intuitive of a move. There’s Macs out there right now in fact with little iOS flavors and ARM processors inside controlling the touchbar and Touch ID! Not even Apple’s marketing department has a good distinction between the kind of people who should be using a MacBook Air or an iPad Pro. Today, we know an iPad Pro is vastly more limited in comparison to a MacBook Air’s feature set, for a lot of people (maybe not most). But we also know that today is not an indicator of tomorrow. Just as Chromebooks were laughed at during their introduction, today they own the US education market and have become serious options for those who live their PC lives inside a web browser (read: most people). In no time will an iPad Pro have the advanced UI features and applications people are accustomed to from their PCs. At that time, should the Mac have not underwent a significant transformation already to avoid iPod-level fadeout post-iPhone, it will make little sense for Apple to have yearly feature updates and hardware refreshes for a legacy platform. </p>
    <img src="images/applePost/ipadvsmac.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>Concurrently selling 4 iPhone models, where the distinction perhaps is not as clear by name alone, is a different story of a different Apple. Worth noting, however, is the largest of these iPhones, iPhone XS Max, has a screen diagonal of 6.5”. That’s not too far off from the almost-defunct iPad Mini (7.9”), which Apple possibly will refresh soon. However, interestingly enough, the XS Max offers virtually no features or software goodies that take advantage of this massive display. Yeah you can turn the display sideways and see a list of your messages AND your messages simultaneously. Nice. That’s the differentiator between a 4” iPhone SE and the mini tablet of a phone that is the $1000+ XS Max. Owning one of these iPhones is akin to owning a small iPad (especially if you opt to get the LTE version). The app selection is the same, but limited (iPad apps take wonderful advantage of the large screen real estate, instead of just scaling up). True multitasking is nonexistent for artificial reasons (we have fanless processors clocking in faster than full blown Intel laptop processors and screens almost twice as big as the original iPhone, but a picture-in-picture mode is impossible?). In fact, beyond the camera system and screen sizes, I cannot think of a major differentiator between the iPad lineup and the iPhone lineup. The operating system is the same, but with limitations imposed on the iPhone for reasons beyond me (I know Apple has UI designers that can figure out how to do split-view on a XS Max). This leads me to wonder how Apple is poised to handle foldable smartphones, a natural and inevitable evolution of the iPhone. A folding XS Max would yield a diagonal of >8 inches and a lot more screen surface area. A trifold XS Max would approach regular iPad sized territory. In a world where a 4” iPhone has virtually no software distinction from a 6.5” one, how will a 9” iPhone fare against an 11” iPad? Surely the selling point of such a device would be its ability to transform into an iPad and take advantage of that screen real estate. Then what is the selling point of an iPad? Much like an iPad Pro is slowly encroaching on the Mac’s user base, the currently-lite edition of an iPad seems to be any of the new iPhones, which are set to evolve into devices that encroach on the iPad’s user base. When you have two dominant devices with such a similar feature set as a huge iPhone and an iPad Pro, which are you really selling and to whom? Do people really need all of those devices or is the single purpose device on the rise? </p>
    <img src="images/applePost/patent.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>The story doesn’t end there, as Apple has a huge stake in something that might evolve to be their “next iPhone”. The wearables market. This goes way deeper than a little Watch that tracks your heartbeat and shows you texts you get from your phone. The Apple Watch is the single best example of a focused standalone device in Apple’s lineup where they seem to have a clear idea to justify its existence as something more than a little iPhone you strap to your wrist (with standalone LTE, it seems like that still is a strong vision Apple has for this product). This is Apple’s foray into health, and their investment into advanced sensors and tracking reflects their seriousness about this product. So much so, that I think the Apple Watch and AirPods are going to be a huge part of their future in consumer electronics. Specifically, their interest in developing augmented reality glasses shows their willingness to experiment with new computing ideas and paradigms. Where iPad, iPhone, and Mac are tried and tested, Apple is looking to wearables to develop a new series of experiences and use cases for the upcoming decades of the company. Hiring Google’s chief of AI is a telltale sign of their interest in furthering Siri into some sort of interaction model for a world without keyboards perhaps, where your AirPods are akin to the personal assistant from the movie Her, your Watch is your “on at all times” primary computing device for hailing Ubers and controlling your smart home, and your world is your interface thanks to augmented reality glasses. This is the kind of ambition that is absent from the largely matured smartphone and tablet/PC marketplace, where exciting things are still happening, but it’s more like confusion trying to settle down instead of revolution happening (that took place in the late 2000’s).</p>
    <img src="images/applePost/arkit.jpeg" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>So what do we have today? We have a watch that can play music, send texts, take phone calls and track a ton of biometrics for health. It is dying to be a standalone product, and one day it will be. We have a phone that can essentially do the same (minus the health tracking, which to be fair is a major distinguisher and a step in the right direction) but on a much larger screen, take astonishing photos, and has a large selection of apps (some of which are actually the full sized versions of the ones available on the Watch). We have a tablet that can essentially do the same (minus the astonishing photos part), but on a much larger screen, and has a large selection of apps (sound familiar?). We have a laptop that can essentially do the same, but on an even larger screen, and with a large set of apps, where many are legacy however and a lot of the new and influential ones do not exist. There are problems visible in this lineup that need to be fixed. When your products are so similar, yet so distinct, but on a path of convergence, you must look to their strong suites and do what differentiates them best to give them purpose. It is obvious, with ARkit, Apple is setting up an augmented reality future piggybacking off the success of its past (and present) with iOS. One that will have a new yet to be announced product at the centerpiece.  With Apple Watch, Apple must continue to build more health related features (as it did with ECG) and continue down its current trajectory of turning a highly advanced piece of tech into fashion, a strategy that has been part of Apple’s DNA forever. iPhone must evolve too, with a focus on photography (there is a reason the iPhone is the world’s most popular camera year after year) and hardware innovation from Apple Research (foldability isn’t some weird trend, it’s the future). The iPad must cement its place as a Pro consumer device for getting work done. This means converging the Mac line with the iPad line and engineering devices that bring the high quality touch experience (and don’t forget Apple Pencil, something that would be appreciated by millions of creatives using the Mac and some Bamboo device plugged into it) and beloved macOS feature set and productivity together into a beautiful product. Apple has a strong foundation in its loyal user base, hundreds of billions in cash, and world class people working for them. It remains to be seen whether they can produce the next revolution in consumer electronics with those indispensable resources. A company of such enormity rarely falls into irrelevance quickly, which is why the plethora of “Apple is doomed” articles that make their rounds regularly (often after reporting a drop in quarterly revenue that’s something like from 10 bazillion to 9.9 bazillion) should generally be shrugged off. But big, does not mean bulletproof.</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><h2>Exploring the Philips Wake-up Light</h2></button>
    <div class="content">
    <img src="images/philipsClock/IMG_1250.JPG" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>The Philips Wake-up light is something of a retrofuturistic device, an alarm clock designed for the future by people living in an earlier era. The concept is simple, replicate a sunrise anywhere from 20-40 minutes before your alarm to wake you up naturally, with gentle sounds playing as the alarm. This post is not about the effectiveness that Philips claims for this clock in waking you up, it is instead a dive into the industrial design and user interaction model of this product. In a time when even Philips has seemingly moved on with its Hue line of bulbs, relegating “sunrise wake-up” to a feature meant to be toggled inside an app, how does the $140 Wake-up light stack up?</p>
    <img src="images/philipsClock/IMG_1252.JPG" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>The Philips Wake-up light is a handsome product. The dualshot plastic body is more sophisticated than a basic matte or glossy solid color plastic finish and appears more apt to a device meant to be used in the home than a textured/patterned surface (a la Jawbone). It is complemented perfectly on the front face of the clock with the same dual-shot design. The whole device seems to be one contiguous body with only the ring of buttons acting as the unsightly seam (more on that later). Apparent in this photo another unsightly element of the product, the unusually long and wiry FM antenna. Perhaps a better design choice would’ve been to construct the white plastic band around the clock out of metal and use that as an antenna, but perhaps they had their reasons not to do so.</p>
    <img src="images/philipsClock/IMG_1251.JPG" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>On the back of the product, the infuriatingly placed speaker grill can be seen. For some reason unknown to me, companies continue producing devices with speakers that do not face their users. In doing so (especially depending on what may reside behind the device) the audio is muffled or lower than anticipated. Placing the speaker perhaps on the bottom front face of the clock would have been greatly appreciated, with laser drilled holes as opposed to the massive boombox-style grill we have now. This shot also gives a better look at how light plays with the dual shot plastic body, very well. The back is unfettered from buttons or switches, thankfully, and just houses a proprietary power plug (a fine decision, as the power input needed for this thing likely exceeds what a regular USB-C power source provides, and that market remains too fragmented to bother with).</p>
    <img src="images/philipsClock/IMG_1268.JPG" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>The power adapter is well designed in that the prongs were placed on the same axis as the adapter itself. Doing so saves a lot of space in the outlet once plugged in, and is a wildly appreciated design touch in a world where power adapters use one, but take the space of two (sometimes three on an outlet extender) outlets. Where a design choice falls short is the use of two strand wires adhered together instead of being encased in a cylindrical or fettuccine cable. For those unfamiliar, your phone charger, while appearing to be one cable, actually houses several wires inside. Same with your wired headphones (some Beats headphone cables resemble a fettuccine noodle, hence the name I use. This combats tangling). Cables have been this way for several years now, and Philips’ oversight in shipping a power adapter with strung together wires as such strikes me as another example of this product having one foot solidly planted in the past.</p>
    <img src="images/philipsClock/IMG_1254.JPG" width="40%" height="40%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>I have a tumultuous relationship with the buttons on this device. But before that, just take notice at the two visible seams (one on the white plastic between the buttons, other below it on the transparent plastic). Take notice at the seemingly unnecessary perimeter venting as well (this device does not need that kind of airflow). I’ll let you formulate your opinions on those subjects. Now onto the buttons. First, facing this clock and using the buttons is impossible without muscle memory and plain old memory itself. Either you memorize the button layout and use the bumps on some of them to navigate your fingers around, or you get up and move your head around the perimeter of the clock, searching for buttons (very likely in the dark, where they lack even the most basic of illumination techniques such as glow in the dark radium). Unlike the other aspects of the clock, the buttons are very cheaply constructed, giving a very hollow click when pressed and wobbling around in place. Unfortunately, instead of consolidating all input in one place, there are more buttons (this time, touch-sensitive) on the front face of the clock (where they all should belong actually).</p>
    <img src="images/philipsClock/IMG_1263.JPG" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>A cool design touch is the illumination of the buttons as your finger approaches them. This is made possible I’m guessing by cranking the capacitive sensitivity of these buttons up to an 11. Unfortunately, this is also made useless as the button titles are not illuminated. Remembering which button is “menu” and which is “select” is not a task I expect to do on my $140 alarm clock. Another example of where user interaction falls short is having to hit the “+” button 30 times to set my alarm to 8:30 AM. Perhaps buttons are not the best mode of input for a device such as this. Also visible in this photo is the digital clockface, which would be fine were it colored white and the time was the only thing it was displaying.</p>
    <img src="images/philipsClock/IMG_1297.JPG" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>However, it is an ominously glowing red that in a dark room at night bleeds beyond the lit up portions of the clock face. Instead of being a potentially cool-looking matrix LED setup, the display has precut shapes for the icons that strongly resemble the hunky black plastic bedside alarm clocks from the 90s. The LEDs used to illuminate the buttons below are for some reason a distinct color from the clock face. A better-suited display would’ve been a front-lit, touchscreen e-ink panel. Such a display would remove pretty much all non-essential buttons from the actual housing of the device, add more interaction models (such as sliders for volume or alarm time), and look much more elegant (a glowing monochromatic display versus an 80s themed seven segment display, you decide). The quality of the image I embedded reflects my displeasure with such aspects of this product.</p>
    <img src="images/philipsClock/IMG_1256.JPG" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>Again, the product is handsome indeed. At first look it certainly does not look like any alarm clock that precedes it, resembling the Sun itself. I’m sure that was the motif. The plastic acts as a wonderful diffuser, with no semblance of bright spots or light leaks from the main bulb itself. Some things Philips wholeheartedly nails, and the execution of the light is extraordinary, transitioning between, red, orange, and finally a warm white as smoothly as possible.</p>

    <p>In the end, the Philips Wake-up light is what it is. It’s what you get when a company focused primarily on lighting decides to make an all-in-one consumer electronics product. This is a product that does not know daylight savings time exists, and when unplugged forgets what time it is. This is not a product born out of competitive Silicon Valley tech product culture, and there is no Steve Jobsian dictatorial figure at the head of it all shelving products and disbanding teams because of one small detail. Today, the clock seems to have been discontinued in all sense of the word except production and distribution. Years have gone by with no major updates to the line, and with Philips aggressively pushing their Hue lights, sunrise wake-up has been rolled into a bullet point feature rather than a headliner. The whole saga reflects the ongoing assault on specific-use consumer technology. In a world of multifunction devices, Philips had access to a specialized technology not yet completely commercialized as an iPhone app. This is what has come out of it. The reason the Kindle has been able to survive is impeccable engineering, innovation, promotion, and support. Opting instead to stagnate their product and selling it at full price years later, Philips has done a disservice and dished an insult by forcing users to purchase Hue bulbs, a Hue bridge, and use a mobile app to have their upgraded experience of a wake-up light when a single self-contained product was serviceable in the past. Perhaps we are doomed for this complexity that is shrouded in the false veil of simplicity, where our product ecosystems merge and complicate our lives, while companies eager to sell us this vision of the future promise the exact opposite.</p>
    
    <p><h2>Update:</h2>Sitting around my room with nothing better to do and a spare USB LED lamp, I decided to scrap together my own version of the wakeup light. Now, this takes into account absolutely none of the criticism from above, as this was a project with essentially 0 budget and completed in roughly an hour and a half. It is more of a fun little experiment that replicates the basic functionality of the alarm clock that the multibillion dollar Philips corporation came up with, and you can build one too with a microcontroller such as an Arduino, a transistor, and a USB powered lamp. Below is what it looks like.</p>
